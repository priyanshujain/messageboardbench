def expected_black_ball_position(N: int, K: int) -> int:
    """ There are N-1 white balls and one black ball arranged in a row, with the black ball
    initially at the leftmost position. Takahashi performs K operations, where each operation
    consists of:
    - Choose two integers a and b uniformly at random between 1 and N, inclusive
    - If a ≠ b, swap the a-th and b-th balls from the left

    Find the expected position of the black ball after K operations, modulo 998244353.

    The result is returned as an integer R where R × Q ≡ P (mod 998244353), where P/Q is
    the expected value expressed as an irreducible fraction.

    Args:
        N: Total number of balls (1 ≤ N ≤ 998244352)
        K: Number of operations (1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5)

    Returns:
        The expected position modulo 998244353
